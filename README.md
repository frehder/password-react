# Over-engineered Pseudo Password Generator

This is a little over-engineered sample project as a tech demo.

This password generator creates long but simple passwords which are build of small blocks of letters and numbers which are connected by a divider char. The idea was to create passwords which are pretty long and as random as possible for security, and be split into small blocks for ease of dictation.

- **Word of warning: The generated letters and numbers are not really random!** ([Pseudorandomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness))
- Used Technology: Typescript, React, React-Redux, Redux Toolkit, Styled-Components
